  <h1>Learning Journal</h1>

  <p class="evidence-intro">
    This journal records my progress, challenges, strategy changes, and reflections throughout my Japanese learning journey
    aligned to JLPT N5. It also documents how I collected evidence (screenshots, notes, Anki reviews, and immersion activities)
    for my learning portfolio.
  </p>

  <!-- WEEK 1 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 1 – Planning & Goal Setting</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        This week focused on setting a clear learning goal and translating it into measurable outcomes. I decided that “learning Japanese”
        is too broad, so I anchored my project to JLPT N5 as a concrete target. I broke the goal into skills: kana fluency (Hiragana/Katakana),
        foundational grammar patterns, vocabulary building, and basic listening/reading ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        I researched different approaches: structured grammar-first study vs. immersion-based learning. I explored Tae Kim’s Guide to understand
        how beginner grammar is sequenced and what “core grammar” looks like (particles, copula, basic verb forms). I also researched Anki as a
        retention system and learned why active recall + spaced repetition is commonly used for language learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> JLPT N5 is achievable when I treat it as a set of micro-skills, not one huge task. A good plan needs a main
        curriculum + review system + evidence capture.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 2 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 2 – Building a Study System</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        I refined my weekly plan and decided how I would capture learning evidence. I listed what “proof” looks like: kana practice screenshots,
        Anki deck stats, Wagotabi vocabulary/grammar screenshots, and short reflections explaining what I understood and what I struggled with.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied Anki mechanics in more detail (new cards vs. review cards, interval scheduling, and why consistency matters more than “cramming”).
        For grammar, I skimmed Tae Kim’s early sections and noted the concepts that would likely cause confusion later (particles, verb conjugations,
        and sentence order).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> A learning project becomes easier when the “system” is prepared first. Evidence capture should be done while
        learning, not at the end.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 3 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 3 – Hiragana Foundations</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        I started Hiragana using Anki and a kana reference (Uchisen). I focused on recognition and reading fluency, not just memorising a chart.
        I practised confusing pairs (さ/き/ち, ぬ/め/ね, れ/わ) and used repetition until recognition felt automatic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside kana, I read Tae Kim’s introduction to understand basic Japanese sentence structure. I learned that particles are essential because
        Japanese relies less on word order and more on markers like は/が/を to show roles in a sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Kana fluency is the “gateway skill.” Without it, everything else becomes slower because I will constantly be decoding.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 4 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 4 – Katakana + Early Grammar Attempts</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        I began Katakana using Anki and Uchisen charts. I paid extra attention to characters that look similar to each other or to Hiragana
        (シ/ツ, ソ/ン, ノ/メ, ル/レ). I also practised reading loanwords to make Katakana feel practical rather than abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
        I attempted to start Tae Kim’s grammar more seriously (copula / basic sentence patterns). I could understand the explanation when reading,
        but I noticed I struggled to produce my own examples confidently. That showed me I needed more contextual reinforcement, not just reading explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Recognising Katakana improves real-world exposure (signs, menus, names). For grammar, understanding ≠ ability to use.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 5 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 5 – Nouns, Adjectives, and Simple Sentences</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        This week I focused on forming very simple sentences using nouns/adjectives and polite patterns. I practised identifying the topic of a sentence,
        and experimented with building short statements like “X is Y” and “X is not Y” in a beginner-friendly structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started collecting vocabulary that appeared repeatedly in beginner materials and reinforced it using Anki. My key difficulty was that grammar study
        felt “dry,” and I caught myself losing momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> I need a learning method that makes grammar feel usable (seeing it in action), otherwise motivation drops.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 6 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 6 – Verbs & Polite Form (ます)</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        I focused on verbs and polite form (ます). I learned that many beginner sentences rely on the pattern “(topic) は (object) を (verb-ます)”.
        This gave me a practical template to understand a lot of early Japanese.
      </p>
      <p>
        I practised recognising verbs in dictionary form vs. polite form and began building awareness of conjugation categories. I also noted that rote memorisation
        of conjugation tables felt slow without context.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> The ます-form is extremely high-value for N5 comprehension. Even if I can’t conjugate perfectly yet,
        recognising the pattern helps me understand sentences quickly.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 7 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 7 – Discovering Refold & Immersion</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        While continuing grammar study, I came across the Refold language learning approach,
        which emphasises immersion and consistent exposure to the target language.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned that immersion does not mean understanding everything immediately,
        but rather exposing myself to Japanese content regularly so that patterns
        become familiar over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this week onward, I began incorporating immersion alongside my structured learning.
        I started watching Japanese YouTube content such as vlogs and gaming videos
        created for Japanese audiences. I also began listening to more Japanese music
        on Spotify.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Even when I cannot understand everything,
        consistent exposure trains listening familiarity and reduces the mental barrier
        to the language.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 8 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 8 – Discovering Wagotabi</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        After experimenting with grammar-heavy study and beginning immersion,
        I decided to look for a more engaging structured system.
        This is when I discovered Wagotabi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wagotabi presents Japanese learning in a game format, gradually introducing
        vocabulary and sentence patterns in context. I found it much easier to follow
        because I simply needed to boot up the game and progress naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion through YouTube and Spotify continued alongside this,
        reinforcing sounds and rhythm outside of structured gameplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Engagement and structure together
        make learning far more sustainable.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 9 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 9 – Particles in Context (は / を)</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        Through Wagotabi, I encountered repeated sentence structures such as:
        Topic は Object を Verb ます.
        I began clearly understanding how は marks the topic and を marks the direct object.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, sentences like 「女の子はパンを買います」 became easier to parse
        because I could identify each grammatical role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion continued daily through Japanese YouTube videos and music.
        Even when comprehension was partial, I began recognising familiar words
        from Wagotabi appearing in spoken content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Seeing grammar in context repeatedly
        builds intuitive understanding.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 10 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 10 – Verb Forms & Reinforcement</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        Continued progressing through Wagotabi lessons,
        encountering verbs in polite form (ます) such as 買います and 食べます.
        I became more comfortable recognising these forms instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion through Spotify and YouTube remained consistent.
        I began noticing recurring phrases and intonation patterns
        even if I did not fully understand full sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Repeated exposure across multiple mediums
        strengthens retention and recognition speed.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 11 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 11 – Question Structures & Vocabulary Growth</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        This week I encountered question structures ending in か
        and began recognising how yes/no questions are formed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vocabulary expanded further, including words like 肉, 魚, 弁当, and パン.
        Seeing these words repeatedly in sentences improved recall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion remained ongoing. I watched Japanese vlogs
        and gaming videos aimed at native speakers, allowing me
        to hear natural conversational rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Vocabulary retention improves when
        reinforced in structured lessons and heard in real-life content.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 12 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 12 – Increased Reading Fluency</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        Continued progressing through Wagotabi.
        By this point, Hiragana and Katakana recognition became significantly faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        I no longer needed to decode every character slowly,
        which allowed me to focus more on understanding sentence meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion continued consistently through music and YouTube,
        further increasing familiarity with pronunciation patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Automatic recognition reduces cognitive load
        and improves comprehension speed.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 13 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 13 – Pattern Recognition</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        Began recognising sentence structures more intuitively
        instead of translating word-by-word.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeated exposure to patterns like Topic + は + Object + を + Verb
        allowed me to understand beginner sentences more fluidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion remained part of my routine.
        I increasingly noticed words from Wagotabi appearing in songs
        and spoken content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Recognition becomes automatic
        when exposure is frequent and varied.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 14 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 14 – Balancing Learning & Portfolio</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        Began building my e-portfolio website.
        Although Japanese study time reduced slightly,
        I continued progressing through Wagotabi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion through YouTube and Spotify remained consistent.
        Even with reduced structured study time,
        exposure to Japanese continued daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Consistency does not require large time blocks.
        Even moderate exposure maintains progress.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 15 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 15 – Slower but Continuous Progress</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        Continued Wagotabi progression at a slightly slower pace
        due to portfolio commitments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion remained consistent. I continued listening to Japanese music
        and watching native content, maintaining exposure to real spoken language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Long-term language growth depends on sustainability,
        not speed.
      </p>

  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 16 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 16 – Strengthening Familiarity</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        Continued structured progression in Wagotabi,
        encountering cumulative vocabulary and grammar patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion continued consistently.
        Familiar words became easier to catch in spoken content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Familiarity grows gradually through repetition
        across different contexts.
      </p>

  </div>

  <!-- WEEK 17 -->
  <div class="journal-entry">
    <div class="journal-header"><h3>Week 17 – Continued Learning with Reduced Time</h3><span>+</span></div>
    <div class="journal-content">
      <p>
        While finalising my portfolio,
        Japanese learning continued at a slower pace.
        I still progressed in Wagotabi lessons,
        encountering new words and reinforcing existing grammar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersion remained consistent up to this week,
        through Japanese music and YouTube content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I learned:</strong> Even when time is limited,
        maintaining engagement with the language prevents regression
        and supports long-term growth.
