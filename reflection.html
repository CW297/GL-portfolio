    <p>
      This 17-week journey of learning Japanese was not a straight upward line.
      It involved experimentation, frustration, adjustment, and gradual improvement.
      At the beginning of the project, I assumed that following a well-known grammar
      guide would naturally lead to steady progress. However, I soon realised that
      simply reading explanations did not translate into meaningful comprehension.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spent time researching different learning approaches online, including
      discussions on platforms such as Reddit, where learners shared their
      experiences with various methods. Some advocated heavy grammar study,
      others emphasised immersion, while others recommended strict spaced
      repetition systems. Initially, I tried following advice exactly as written.
      However, I discovered that blindly copying someone else’s method did not
      guarantee results for me personally.
    </p>

    <p>
      The turning point came when I began mixing and matching strategies instead
      of committing rigidly to a single one. I retained useful grammar references
      from Tae Kim, incorporated immersion principles from the Refold approach,
      and eventually adopted Wagotabi as my primary structured learning tool.
      This combination created a system that suited my learning style:
      structured progression through gameplay, reinforced by contextual exposure
      through YouTube and music.
    </p>

    <h2>Ups, Downs, and Adaptation</h2>

    <p>
      The early phase of this project was slower and less efficient than expected.
      I struggled with translating grammar explanations into practical understanding.
      There were moments where progress felt stagnant.
      Instead of abandoning the goal, I reflected on what was not working
      and made deliberate adjustments.
    </p>

    <p>
      After adopting Wagotabi and incorporating consistent immersion,
      learning became smoother and more intuitive. Rather than forcing
      memorisation, I was repeatedly exposed to sentence patterns and vocabulary
      in context. This reduced friction and increased engagement.
    </p>

    <p>
      One important lesson I learned is that effectiveness depends less on
      choosing the “best” method according to others and more on choosing
      the method that aligns with how I personally learn.
    </p>

    <h2>Development of Personal Attributes</h2>

    <h3>Resilience</h3>
    <p>
      Resilience was developed when my initial learning strategy did not produce
      the results I expected. Instead of giving up or assuming I lacked ability,
      I evaluated the process itself. Adjusting my strategy required patience
      and acceptance that early inefficiency is part of long-term growth.
      This mindset is transferable to technical projects in my IIT (AAI) studies,
      where debugging and iteration are normal parts of development.
    </p>

    <h3>Inquisitiveness</h3>
    <p>
      I demonstrated inquisitiveness by actively researching different learning
      philosophies and analysing why certain methods work for some learners.
      Rather than passively consuming advice, I compared approaches,
      experimented, and refined my system.
      This habit of questioning and investigating will be valuable in
      artificial intelligence and technology fields, where continuous learning
      and exploration of new tools are essential.
    </p>

    <h3>Effective Communication</h3>
    <p>
      Although I am still at a beginner level in Japanese, I have developed
      stronger foundational comprehension skills. I can recognise basic sentence
      structures, identify particles such as は and を, and understand simple
      polite verb forms. More importantly, I have learned how communication
      works structurally in another language.
    </p>

    <p>
      This awareness strengthens my ability to think about language systems,
      which connects to programming and AI model design — both require
      understanding structured input and output patterns.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Future Application</h2>

    <p>
      This project has taught me more than just beginner Japanese.
      It has reinforced the importance of building sustainable systems,
      testing strategies, and iterating when necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      In future learning — whether technical skills, programming languages,
      or professional development — I will apply the same principle:
      research widely, experiment carefully, and refine until the system
      fits my workflow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, this journey showed me that effective learning is not about
      copying others perfectly. It is about understanding oneself as a learner,
      building a method that aligns with personal strengths,
      and maintaining steady progress over time.
