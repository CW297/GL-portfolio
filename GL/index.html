  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <!-- Student Information Section -->

    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cedric Wong</p>
    <p><strong>Matrix Number:</strong> 2402539G</p>
    <p><strong>Course:</strong> Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI)</p>
    <p><strong>Module:</strong> Guided Learning</p>

    <p>
      As part of my Guided Learning module, I chose to pursue Japanese language learning
      with the objective of building foundational proficiency aligned with the
      Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) N5 level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than treating this as a casual interest, I structured this project
      around measurable learning outcomes: mastering Hiragana and Katakana,
      understanding fundamental grammar patterns, expanding beginner vocabulary,
      and improving sentence comprehension through consistent exposure.
    </p>

    <p>
      This portfolio documents not only what I learned, but how I learned —
      including strategy adjustments, reflections, immersion practices,
      and evidence collected throughout the 17-week period.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Approach & Evolution</h2>

    <p>
      At the start of this project, I explored traditional grammar-based study
      using Tae Kim’s Guide to Japanese Grammar. While this provided useful
      foundational explanations, I realised that reading grammar alone did not
      translate effectively into practical comprehension.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the middle phase of my project, I discovered the Refold approach,
      which emphasises immersion and consistent exposure to the target language.
      From that point onward, I incorporated regular immersion into my routine
      by watching Japanese YouTube content (vlogs and gaming videos) and
      listening to Japanese music on Spotify.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, I adopted <strong>Wagotabi</strong> as my primary learning platform.
      Wagotabi presents Japanese in a structured, game-based format that
      integrates vocabulary, grammar, and sentence patterns in context.
      This allowed me to progress naturally through lessons while reinforcing
      concepts through repetition and application.
    </p>

    <p>
      To strengthen retention, I used <strong>Anki</strong> as a supplementary
      spaced-repetition tool. Vocabulary and patterns encountered in Wagotabi
      were reinforced through review, improving recall and reading speed.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>

    <p>
      The primary objective of this project is to develop foundational
      Japanese proficiency consistent with JLPT N5 level expectations.
      This includes understanding basic sentence structure,
      recognising polite verb forms, and reading simple beginner-level sentences with confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond language acquisition, this project also aimed to cultivate
      key personal attributes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resilience</strong> – adjusting strategies when initial methods were ineffective.</li>
      <li><strong>Inquisitiveness</strong> – researching alternative approaches and refining my learning system.</li>
      <li><strong>Effective Communication</strong> – developing the ability to interpret structured language patterns.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This portfolio serves as a comprehensive record of my learning journey,
      supported by documented evidence, weekly reflections, and structured progression.
